# 👋 Hello, I'm Liam!

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a Computer Science engineering student at CESI Nancy, passionate about **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and all things **tech**.  
Currently in the engineering cycle after completing a two-year integrated prep course, I'm always curious and driven to explore new challenges — especially in the digital world.

## 🔐 Focus: Cybersecurity & Networking
From configuring secure remote access via AutoSSH, to migrating virtualization systems and automating vulnerability reports in Python — cybersecurity isn't just a field I'm interested in, it's where I’m headed!

## 📚 Education
🎓 **CESI École d’Ingénieurs – Nancy, France**  
- Engineering Program, Computer Science specialization  
- Preparatory Integrated Cycle (2021–2023)
